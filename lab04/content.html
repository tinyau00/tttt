Why BSc Creative Media?
Our programme delivers interdisciplinary teaching by crossing the boundaries among digital media, design, and computer science, which bridges creative and technical sides of computer-based media art production. Students will be trained in computer graphics, digital imaging, mobile media, user-interface (UI) and user-experience (UX) design, computer games and interactive media.
